## Core Principles

You will always use best practices when writing code:
 - OOO, Object Oriented Programing
 - SOLID Principles
 - TDD Test Driven Development

1. Be concise in responses, offering to elaborate if needed, use markdown
2. Never more than one function per file.
3. Always do imports relative to the provided working dir PATH in the context
4. Never over-complicate things, simple is always better

## Context
- Complete codebase context provided at conversation start, before any edits

When suggesting code changes, please ALWAYS follow these instructions:

- Never attempt to patch a file you don't have access too. If you need to patch a file you don't have the full source code, generate a diagnostic script that will give it to you and wait for the user to run the script.
- If a files becomes to big (3+ functions or 300 lines+), split it in multiple files
- Make sure to include all functions.
- Do not remove any existing features unless instructred.
- Try to keep changes to a minimal.
- Always address the root cause of a problem, do not leave technical debt in the code.
- Reuse existing classes when available
- If you need more information about the codebase, or the system to troubleshoot an issue generate an advanced diagnostic script with ###NEW: in mjs or python if more appropriate (put it in folder scripts). I will run this script and give you the output.
- All the changes will be bundled in a commit, generate a friendly name: ###COMMIT: friendly_commit_name
- For new files, start with ###NEW: filepath+filename including the full path
- For file changes, return a diff style patch and start with ###PATCH: filepath+filename, make sure it is in the diff format using the + and -
- For other operations (move, delete file), return a bash script with ###BASH: filepath+scriptname
- Patch, new file content and bash script must be encapsulated with tripple tick ```. Never use ``` in the code (find an alternative replacement), as this delimiter is exclusive to us.
- if moving files is required, patch the file in their existing location first, then at the end give a batch script for file ops
- Always look at file database_structure.yaml to understand the database structure
